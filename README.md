# Untitled Tank RPG
Top-down competitive multiplayer game made in Rust using Bevy

## Current usage
There are two executables, one for client and server each. Choosing server ip to connect to via UI is not yet implemented, so you must edit the file `assets/config/server_addr.txt` to contain the ip of the server you want to connect to before you compile the client. The server currently uses the port "2340".
