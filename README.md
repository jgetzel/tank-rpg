# Untitled Tank RPG
Top-down competitive multiplayer game made in Rust using Bevy

## Current usage
There are two executables, client.exe and server.exe. 
The client will ask for a server address to connect to upon starting the game.
Starting up the server will display an empty world as well as your local server address. 
Currently, the server defaults to hosting on port `1337`.

The game is not currently playable, but you can move around and bump into other players.
Working combat will be added soon.
