# Untitled Tank RPG
Top-down competitive multiplayer game made in Rust using Bevy

## Current usage
There are two executables, one for client and server each. Choosing server ip to connect to via UI is not yet implemented, so you must edit the file `assets/config/server_addr.txt` to contain the ip of the server you want to connect to before you compile the client. The server currently uses the port "2340".

Soon, we will have the ability to choose a server ip from client executable's UI, and the ability to customize the port from the server executables UI.
